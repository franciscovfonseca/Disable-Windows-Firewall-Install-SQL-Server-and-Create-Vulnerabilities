In this lab we're going to install and set up a **SQL Server Database** inside of the **Windows Virtual Machine**.

We're also going to **Disable the Windows VM's Internal Firewall**.

Finally we'll **Remote Desktop Protocol** into the **Linux VM** and also **Test Ping and Log into it via SSH**, to make sure we can log in and everything is working.

<br>

The first step is to copy the **Public IP Address** of the ```windows-vm```

Using the **Microsoft Remote Desktop** ‚ûú Remote into the VM using that IP Address and:

- Username: ```labuser```
- Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

<summary> <h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Turn off Windows Firewall</h2> </summary>
<br>

> By **Turnning off the Firewall**, the Virtual Machine is essentially going to respond to ping requests and all sorts of traffic ‚ûú making it easier to be discovered on the internet by bad actors.
> 
> We have previously opened up the **NSG** (which in a sense is the **Azure Firewall**), but inside of the Operating System there's another **Firewall** ‚ûú so we're going to disable that.

<br>

Back in our Wondows Vm, the first thing to do is **Disable the Internal Windows Firewall**.

Inside the Windows Firewall ‚ûú click on **Windows Defender Firewall Properties**.

Then trun of the **Firewall State** for the **Domain**, **Private** and **Public Profiles**:

<br>

You can **[Download SQL Server here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2019)**

Download the EXE file and install it on the VM:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdfec461-080f-4c95-b1cf-642b9f51bbb8)

In this case we're going to **Download Media**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7ada334-1027-4d79-96a6-64c0d3886a51)

We'll download an **ISO** and put it on the **Desktop**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/102e4370-e867-4abe-b528-a7d06e25cbea)

After it's been downloaded, right-click the ISO file and click **Mount**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e09133dd-5867-4e4e-b119-f4ea8f37358c)

Look for the **SqlSetup** on your PC and then actaully install SQL by clicking on the **setup** file:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3adff4a4-f948-40c4-a01b-23a1c164d9a8)

Afte the SQL setup opens, just click **Instalation** and then **New SQL Server stand-alone installation**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9aa18d0-f3bb-405d-a874-d64c149c1a59)

Accept the "license terms" and click "Next" until reaching the **Feature Selection** Tab where you want to tick the ‚òë **Database Engine Services** check box:

We'll use ***Mixed Mode for SQL Server Authentication and Windows Authentication***:

By default SQL Server can have an admin account called **"sa"** (for system administrator), so we'll set up the password for this:

- Username: ```sa``` (default)
- Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

We'll also **Add the Current Windows User** ‚ûú which will make our User ```labuser``` able to **Authenticate and Log Into our SQL instance**.

Click on **"Add Current User"** and it will add the current user ```labuser``` as well

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f608f98f-3ae9-4a95-9248-303ef2bfc368)

**<summary> üìù Summary</summary>**

We can view all the logs for the Windows VM through the **Event Viewer**.

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c18ad14-d3fb-4682-8db9-a57ab6afdef7)

For example if we go to Windows **Logs** > **Security** > click on one of the **Events / Logs** ‚ûú we can se the details: ***"An account was successfully logged on."***

Whenever someone fails a login, or has a succesful login ‚ûú that's going to be recorded in the **Event Viewer** and we can see it:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb0cf8e2-5902-4583-ab4f-f64c46db7636)

<br>

> Basically what we're doing right now is set up the **SQL Server** ‚ûú so that when somebody **Fails to Authenticate** against it, we'll be able to see the logs for that in the **Event Viewer**
> 
> And to achieve that we first need to provide full permissions for the SQL Server service account to the registry hive (**Registry Editor**).
> 
> The **Windows Registry** is a place in the computer where we can make a lot of granular configurations to affect the way the OS behaves.

  </details>

<br>

<br>

First we're going to open the **Registry Editor**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34f643ca-676c-475e-ac11-82810483ae7e)

Paste the following Registry path inside it (instead of browsing to it):

```HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Security```

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19e41d71-12c3-42d6-b192-7d82e5d6da0a)

Then we'll right-click the **Security** key > click on **Permissions** > then click on **"Add"**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79bad0cb-5d12-4773-a144-9ad8ae5f78f4)

Add the ```NETWORK SERVICE``` account to the permission > and thick the ‚òë boxes for **"Full Control"** and **"Read"**

Click **"Apply"** and then **"OK"**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ea25590-1cb0-418a-8912-f448496031b2)

<br>

‚û°Ô∏è Now we'll **Enable Auditing from SQL Server**

From the Start menu > type **cmd** > right-click on **Command Prompt** and **Run as administrator**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a55c0a00-dc81-4835-9fc0-dcf11235e5c8)

Paste the following **statement** > press **"Enter"** > and you can see that the command was **successfully executed** ‚úîÔ∏è

```auditpol /set /subcategory:"application generated" /success:enable /failure:enable```

<br>

‚û°Ô∏è The next thing to do is **Open the SSMS** ‚ûú **Log Into It** ‚ûú and **Enable Auditing**.

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/362f6ee4-acfe-47fd-bc7d-24b94123fb84)

- To Connect to the SQL Server ‚ûú  we can select **"SQL Server Authentication"** as the **Authetication** method.
- We'll use the **SQL Server system administrator credentials** we had set up earlier:

  - Username: ```sa```
  - Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8f0b5e9-446e-4cf3-9c38-5c306b2d0094)

Then we'll go to the **Properties** of the Server we just connected to > go to **"Login auditing"** > and check ‚óâ **Both failed and successful logins**

This way all the login attempts can be logged to the **Event Log**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80d51ce4-7e4c-4b12-a44c-7bad576327dc)

And finally we just have to **Restart** the Server ‚ûú right-click on the **windows-VM SQL Server** and click on **"Restart"**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85fbba3d-6c1b-4d9b-a806-114db7dcff9b)

Then close **SSMS** and open the **Event Viewer**.

Under the **Windows Logs** > **Application Log** ‚ûú ‚ö†Ô∏è this is where the **SQL Server Login Attempts** are going to be recorded.

You can see bellow the Event of the **Login failed** we intentionally generated using a Wrong Pasword:

Back to the Azure Portal, we'll go to the ```linux-vm``` > copy the **Public IP Address**

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ae558bf-4af7-4140-85c0-7f137c39af38)

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e4a2035-4501-4f35-b4a0-7088302d8106)

- Then if you're running Windows ‚ûú open **Powershell**-
- But if you're running Mac ‚ûú open **Terminal**

We're going to attempt to ping our **Linux VM** > type in the **IP Address**:

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28439036-1346-4ea0-b75e-77bb28b4dce6)

  ![VM create](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cae7ee3d-74b6-41e4-8f2a-c41a920de014)

Now to SSH into the Virtual Machine, we have our ```linux-vm``` Username & Password:

- Username: ```labuser```
- Password: ```Cyberlab123!```

To connect into a machine with SSH we just type:

```commandline
ssh USERNAME@IPADDRESS

# Conclusion

<br>

In this lab we:

- Disabled the **Internal Firewall on the Windows Computer**.

- Installed the **SQL Server Database into the Windows Computer**.

- Logged into the **Linux Computer with SSH**.

<br />

Now we will leave our Virtual Machines ON for the at least 24 hours

‚û°Ô∏è This will give bad actors, bots or attackers a chance to **Discover our VMs** and **Generate Logs**.
